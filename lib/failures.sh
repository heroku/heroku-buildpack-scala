It looks like your build.sbt does not have a valid 'stage' task.

We're sorry this build is failing. It looks like you may need to run a
clean build to remove any stale SBT caches. You can do this by setting
a configuration variable like this:

    $ heroku config:set SBT_CLEAN=true

Then deploy you application with 'git push' again. If the build succeeds
you can remove the variable by running this command

    $ heroku config:unset SBT_CLEAN

If this does not resolve the problem, please submit a ticket so we
can help: https://help.heroku.com
