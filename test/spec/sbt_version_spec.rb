          remote:  !     Support for sbt 0.x was ended by the upstream sbt project on November 30, 2018.
          remote:  !     
          remote:  !     Please upgrade to sbt 1.x for active support.
          remote:  !     
          remote:  !     The buildpack will attempt to build your application, but compatibility
          remote:  !     is not guaranteed and may break at any time.
